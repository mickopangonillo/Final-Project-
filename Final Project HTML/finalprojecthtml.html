          <p>It’s true that proper footwear can prevent a wide range of injuries. Supportive shoes protect your body from joint damage and pulled muscles and tendons, and ones with proper traction can help stop slips and falls. Good shoes can also keep bunions and strained muscles at bay.</p>

        <h2>Reliable</h2>
        <p>Ukay-ukay refers to the secondhand market in the Philippines. It came from the Filipino word ‘halukay’ which means ‘to dig’ and is also synonymous with wagwagan, which came from the verb ‘wagwag’ – the act of dusting off. One word but interestingly versatile. Ukay-ukay could refer to the secondhand item, the act of buying it, and the place where you buy one. You could say “ukay lang ‘to”, “nag-ukay ako”, “sa ukay lang ‘to” and any Filipino would understand what you mean.</p>
